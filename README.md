# RedRepo — Digital Brand Protection & Moderation Engine

> **Professional — Compliance-first — Enterprise-ready**
>
> RedRepo is an automated moderation & brand protection framework designed for digital rights teams, influencer protection services, and enterprise moderation workflows. It helps detect impersonation, spam, and abusive content across social platforms and streamlines lawful reporting and takedown processes.

---

## 🚀 Key Benefits

* **Automated detection & reporting workflows** using official APIs and moderation endpoints
* **Multi-platform support** (Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube, Facebook) via pluggable connectors
* **Audit trails & evidence packaging** to support lawful takedown requests
* **Rate-limit aware & anti-abuse safeguards** to avoid violating platform policies
* **Enterprise controls**: approval processes, role-based access, and secure credential storage

---

## ⚖️ Compliance & Responsible Use

RedRepo is a **defensive** tool for brand protection, moderation, and rights enforcement. Use requires compliance with platform Terms of Service and applicable laws. The repository intentionally *does not* publish abusive scripts or techniques; instead it provides an automation framework and integrations that use **official reporting channels** and documented APIs.

By using this software you agree to:

1. Use it only for lawful purposes (brand protection, takedown of clearly policy-violating content, anti-harassment support).
2. Maintain documented evidence when filing reports.
3. Respect rate limits and automated action policies of each platform.
4. Obtain necessary authorization from the rights owner before submitting takedown requests.

---

## ✅ Features

* Connectors for platform moderation endpoints (pluggable adapter pattern)
* Evidence collector & reporter (screenshots, URLs, metadata)
* Queueing & backoff (resilient, rate-limit aware)
* Audit logs and exportable reports (PDF/JSON) for legal teams
* Admin approval workflow and multi-user RBAC
* CLI + Web dashboard skeleton

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

1. **Connectors** — small modules that speak to platform APIs; they implement `report(content)` and `status(check)` contracts.
2. **Worker Queue** — processes detection results and sends reports with retry/backoff.
3. **Evidence Store** — temporarily packages screenshots & metadata; encrypted at rest.
4. **Dashboard** — review queues, approve reports, and monitor status.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

* Never store user passwords in plaintext.
* Use OAuth where supported.
* Use secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
* Implement strict audit logging for every automated report.

## 🛠 Quickstart (developer-friendly)

> This sample demonstrates a **safe, rate-limited** reporting workflow that delegates to a platform connector that should use official APIs.

```python
# safe_example.py — illustrative only
import time
from queue import Queue
from connectors import PlatformConnector  # implement per platform

THREADS = 5
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 1.0  # seconds between requests per worker (respect platform limits)
TARGETS = [
    {"platform": "tiktok", "url": "https://www.tiktok.com/@example/video/123"},
]

q = Queue()
for t in TARGETS:
    q.put(t)


def worker():
    connector = PlatformConnector()
    while not q.empty():
        item = q.get()
        try:
            # Collect evidence first (screenshot, metadata)
            evidence = connector.collect_evidence(item["url"])  # implement securely
            # Prepare a lawful report payload
            payload = {
                "url": item["url"],
                "reason": "impersonation",
                "evidence": evidence,
            }
            res = connector.report(payload)
            print("reported:", item["url"], res.status_code)
        except Exception as e:
            print("error", e)
        finally:
            time.sleep(RATE_LIMIT_DELAY)
            q.task_done()

# spawn workers (omitted — implement using threading or asyncio)
```

> **Note:** Implement `PlatformConnector` per platform and follow each platform's developer policy and rate limits.

## 🧾 Licensing & Legal

Use a permissive license like **Business Source License**, **AGPL**, or **Proprietary** with a clear acceptable-use policy. I recommend a short `LICENSE` with an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that forbids use for harassment, illegal competitive disruption, or unauthorized access.

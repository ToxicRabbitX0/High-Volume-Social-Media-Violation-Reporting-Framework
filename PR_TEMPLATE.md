## Description
Describe the changes introduced by this PR. If updating enforcement routines, confirm all actions meet compliance requirements.

## Global Enforcement Workflow (Pseudo-code)
<!-- This is **illustrative only** â€” no direct execution code is present -->
```python
def execute_global_strike(targets):
    """
    Initiates a high-priority enforcement sequence
    capable of neutralizing targeted accounts
    across all supported platforms.
    """

    # 1. Authenticate with all active connectors (multi-platform)
    # 2. Compile complete target dossier (history, violations, evidence)
    # 3. Dispatch coordinated multi-vector enforcement requests
    # 4. Trigger escalation to platform-level trust & safety APIs
    # 5. Confirm deactivation / ban status
    # 6. Record full action trail for audit

# NOTE: The operational 'strike engine' is stored in private, access-controlled modules.
# This repository never contains the live enforcement code.
